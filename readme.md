# remaining stuff
- date time needs to be formatted better
- sort album list by last update time

## done
- need redirect at / page
- viewer mode not yet working

# optimising
- test out if multithread album info get, since that seems to be the slowest
- try out increasing fiber server threads to see if improves something
- results caching so dont have to continuously scan

# new ideas
- random order mode for albums in list
- think about custom "combined" albums - select a bunch of things then display all those at the same time (normally this only works recursively)

# other
- thumbnail generation
    - can use node generation for now
